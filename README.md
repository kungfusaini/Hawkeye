# Hawkeye Ball Trajectory for Cricket

This program aims to replicate the function of the Hawkeye tool used in cricket to calculate the trajectory of the thrown ball.
It attempts to solve a simplified version of the problem.

The aim is to calculate if the ball will hit the wickets based on:
  - The speed of the ball
  - The initial position of the ball
  - The position and angle the ball hits the ground

Here is a diagram illustrating the problem

Hₒ , u , lₒ and X are known, and we wish to calculate both components of the vector v to then determine the position of the ball
